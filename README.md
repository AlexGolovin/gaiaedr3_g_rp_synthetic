# gaiaedr3_g_rp_synthetic
This function calculates synthetic (or "deblended") G-RP for datasets from *Gaia* eDR3 using BP-RP photometry as input observable.
The details of this method are described in [Golovin et al. 2022, A&A, submitted]().

### Input
BP-RP value (or an array of values). Note! BP-RP array needs to be in strictly increasing order.

### Applicability range: 
0.0 < BP-RP < 4.25

Please be reminded that the initial purpose of this tool was to be applied on the sample of nearby stars  (*d* â‰¤ 25 pc) from *Gaia* eDR3. No correction for reddening is necessary at this distance limit.
These corrections are to be applied at the discretion of the user, when deriving synthetic G-RP colour values for more distant objects from *Gaia* eDR3 catalogue.
